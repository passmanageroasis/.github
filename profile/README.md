# Introduction

### 1. What is PMO?

* Pass Manager Oasis (PMO) is a web-app password manager software developed by a small team of developers.

### 2. Purpose and goals

* Our main goal is providing and maintaining a **secure** and **trustworthy** environment for the user.

### 3. What makes PMO different from other Password Managers, and why should you use it?

*  #### With PMO we aim to avoid some of the industry standards that would make our services feel corporate, lazy or greedy:
   * We provide **security** and **comfort**, instead of easy access and offline/local availability<sup> **_1_**</sup>.
   * No suspicious activity on your devices.
   * Cross-platform support and availability.
   * Universal design (UX/UI)<sup> **_2_**</sup>.
   * No scummy subscription-based purchases or trials.
   * Full community support, and open-source front-end.
   * Fully anonymous accounts, only there for the user to access their data.
   * Both in-app and server-side multistep encryption.
   * If there are any issues on our end (server breach/data leak) any leaked data will be virtually unusable.
   * Scheduled server maintenance, without risk of dataloss.
  
### 4. Pricing

* Good news is, you get this package entirely for free! All you need is a valid email address, and you're good to go.
* Some features will be only available for Oasis Premium<sup> **_3_**</sup>. users. These features aren't considered necessary for the base product, but are very resource dependant, which is why buying them is a good way of supporting this project. It's a win-win!

### 5. Community

* Communication is important. That's why the user will have many different ways to give feedback and criticism directly to us, including in-app reports and external discussion channels. Communication will be completely anonymous, which we believe will help establish a positive, dedicated and honest community.
